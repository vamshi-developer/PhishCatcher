# PhishCatcher
This Project aims to develop a client-side defense mechanism based on machine learning techniques to detect spoofed web pages and protect users from phishing attacks. As a proof of concept, a Google Chrome extension dubbed Phish Catcher is developed that implements our machine learning algorithm that classifies a URL as suspicious or trustful.
